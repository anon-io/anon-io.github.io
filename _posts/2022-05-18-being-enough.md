I will talk a lot about firsts, but it seems fitting to write this now anyway.

It seems for the first time I will have a manifest interest reciprocated. 
At least, the probability seems non-zero.

But I am yet deeply concerned I am insufficient. 
It is well known that I am inexperienced, and better known (from outward appearances) that I am unfashioned. 
If I succeed and I am able to pass the initial relationship barrier, is it necessarily possible that I am going to maintain my appeal?

I am no romantic, I am no lover, I am a hedonist.
Living this far, I always sought the physical benefits of a relationship, indubitably spurred by hormonal urges. I don't know how to make someone feel loved, besides platonic compassion. 
I don't know what people _do_ to feel compassion. 
Is it a function of money spent? 
Time expended?
Affectionate words said?

That being said, it is already hard for me to know how I should _feel_ to make the relationship fruitful.
I know that in the past I have tried to feel romance and extra-filial love. 
In a couple cases, it so nearly worked, but eventually was torn away from me. 
The repeated experience has left me jaded and unable to affect as much as before. 
I used to go by this pit in my stomach to know when I was truly feeling someone's absence or feeling someone's meaning.
I used to jump inside, feeling a rush of... something?
I no longer know if anyone can ever evoke that for me again.
Then, if I am to enter a relationship, am I able to sustain feeling? 
Am I able to resist the urge to find someone else? 
Thoughts for later.
